# LeafRange
A better range "guess-o-meter" for early Nissan Leaf cars

This project follows on from (and compliments) my earlier [LeafSOCdisplay](https://github.com/PaulKennett/LeafSOCdisplay) project, which grew from [CANa Display for Nissan LEAF](https://ev-olution.yolasite.com/CANa.php) Â© Copyright EV-OLUTION

The project uses an Ardunio Micro (or Mini Pro, or Mega2650) with a 160x128 pixel TFT display and a MCP2515 CAN-bus module. The display is mounted in a 3D printed frame that fits *inside* the main dash unit and covers the old range estimate (ie., the "guess-o-meter") with a less-wrong range based on battery capacity and temperature.

## Features

* a better range estimate in large freindly numerals (this estimate is not stupidly optomistic at the start of the drive)
* range chart that shows how well the estiimate matches reality (stores jouurney data in EEPROM over multiple drives)
* provides the difference between initial range estimate and current estimate plus distance driven
* shows battery pack temperature in Centigrate (more understandable than the temp "bars") 
* auto-starts a trip odo, and
* auto-starts a journey odo (multiple trips on a single charge)

The significance of the range chart feature is that it makes it much easier to adjust your driving to achieve a desired range.

### For example
Say you need to drive 75 km in your 2011 Leafster. You charge to "100%" which gives you a rage estimate of 82km range on my LeafRange display (not that bad for an old gen 1.0 Leaf). The guess-o-meter would be saying something like "103km" which would be a bold-faced lie. 

So you head off, stopping at a few places along the way (my display saves range and odo data along the way). About half way there you notice that the chart is showing you're actually trending _below_ the initial estimate line - meaning you should start to ease off the speed a little so that you won't run short. 

On the other hand - if you see that you're driving _above_ the initial estimate line then you know you have plenty of capacity to spare so can afford to drive faster.

### Limitations

This range estimate is not very sophisticated. It doesn't know about terrain, weather, driving conditions, car weight, etc. The key benefits are; (a) it's not stupidly optomistic at the start of a drive, and (b) the range chart allows you to easily adjust your driving behaviour to achieve a desired range.

## Hardware

1. Arduino Micro, Mini Pro, or Mega2560 (use a Mega2560 for development, use a Micro or Mini Pro for use in the car as it boots up much faster and uses less power)
2. MCP2515 (CAN bus module)
3. 1.8 inch TFT display 160x128 pixels (like this https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000016800528.html)
4. TXS0108E 8 Channel Logic Level Shifter (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001131536726.html)

10. 3D printed project box DRAFT (https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lRlt66oEZCM-leafrange-box-v16 - I'll provide a better link soon}
11. Project "motherboard" DRAFT (for Mega2650 only at this stage https://oshwlab.com/PaulKennett/LeafRange)
12. OBD2 plug (like this https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32865761651.html)

## Todo
- layout an updated motherboard for the Micro/Mini Pro
- redo the project box for the new Micro motherboard
- create a nice wiring diagram (with photos)
- add images to this page 
- test the code works on 2013+ Gen 1.1 Leafs
- get a better photo of it (in daylight)
