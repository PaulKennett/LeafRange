A project to create a small OLED display that fits INSIDE the main dash of a 
2011-2012 Nissan Leaf, over the top of and covering/replacing the 
Guess-o-meter Range estimater (and charge bars).

The LeafRange project is a sister project of my LeafSOC diisplay which was based 
on "CANa Display for Nissan LEAF"  https://ev-olution.yolasite.com/CANa.php

  Modified by Paul Kennett October 2019 to talk to a standard/cheap 128x64 OLED dsiplay.

                    (2) Range is too pessimistic - need to factor in battery SOH
                    (3) Her SOH 2014 Leaf = 85, my SOH 2011 Leaf = 66
                    (4) Her WH_PER_GID = ???,   my WH_PER_GID 74.0F

  V27 - 30 Apr 2021
  Trivial tweaking

  V26 - 24 Apr 2021
  Reintegrating the CAN code and trimming excess code & variables
  
  V25 - 23 Apr 2021
  Finished UI design (for the moment)

  V24 - 19 Apr 2021
  Removing the red and green line code

  V24 - 19 Apr 2021
  RangeP branch is for display in portrait mode
  Begin simplifying range estimate lines to single line
  
  V22 - 8 Feb 2021
  Improving "shaded" lines

  V21 - 28 Dec 2020
  Adding "shaded" lines

  V20 - 27 Nov 2020
  Adding Logisoso font (matches the font used in my LeafSOC project)
  - https://fonts2u.com/logisoso.font
  - using https://rop.nl/truetype2gfx/
  - Logisoso 16pt too big
  - Logisoso 12pt about right

  V17 - 10 Oct 2020
  changed display to 1.8" colour TFT, 128 x 160 px
  changing to use Adafruit GFX lib (rather than U8clib, just to see how I like it. Already missing good font selection)

  V15 - 22 Sept 2020
  started to implement chart scaling - evetually I want the graph to adjust the scale to suit each sessions range
  (ie, if the range is 72 km then I want the graph to zoom in so that the x axes has 72 km at the right side of the display)

  V09 - 26/08/2020
  Improving the Range chart(?)

  V08 - 26/08/2020
  Changing to button reasding code that uses millis and allows for long button press

  V07 - 25 Aug 2020
  Discovered that the rawOdo value from Car-Can (Instrument cluster to BCM, VCM & AV) is in Miles!
  Making do with rawOdo as a 2 byte value. I haven't figuired out how to union all 3 bytes (embarrising),
  but I don't actualy need all 3 bytes.

  V06 - 12/8/2020
  Still trying to crack the Odometer data fields - AAAARGH!

  V05
  Added summer and winter range to Range vs Distance chart

  V04
  Added Range chart (looks good, but still missing the Odometer data)
  Added Range
  Added Battery SOH
  Added Gids
  Added Odometer (does not work)
  Added Time (does not work)
  Added Battery Temp (not completely sure it's right though)
  Moved 12V Battery to the last page (does not work)
  Removed Throttle (even though it's cool)

  V03
  cleaning out the old EV-CAN stuff

  V01 (based off Leaf SOC project code)
  Starting to play with the Car-CAN instead of the EV-CAN
